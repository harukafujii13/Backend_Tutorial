//Function decrypt(data):
//This function is a placeholder for a decryption algorithm. It takes data as an argument and returns a string "decrypted data".
//In a real-world scenario, this would involve actual decryption logic.

//Function read():
//This function calls the decrypt function with a hardcoded string "data" and returns its result.
//It's a simplified representation of a process that might involve reading encrypted data and then decrypting it.
